# Week4_Oct26th_Homework

Some personal choices were made in how the scoring is done as well as the timers count down.  I made the timer unaffected by the scoring because to me that made more sense.

This Webpage provides a short Javascript quiz that is timed and scored based off the right answers and time submitted.

The questions will randomize as well as the answer choices so it will take actual sight reading ability to do it quickly.

it also stores the highscores up to top 5 and can be cleared at users wish.


timer is top right.
